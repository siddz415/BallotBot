# Supporting Reproductive Rights*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Friday, July 26, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City’s Department of Public Health (DPH) offers reproductive health care. DPH supports the right to access the full range of reproductive health care, including abortions.

A “limited services pregnancy center” primarily provides services to pregnant people but does not provide abortion or emergency contraceptive services or referrals for such services. City law prohibits these centers from disseminating untrue or misleading information about the services they provide.

City law allows limited services pregnancy centers and clinics that provide abortions to operate primarily on the ground floor in designated districts in San Francisco.

State law prohibits the City from cooperating with or providing information to any law enforcement agency of another state or the federal government regarding a lawful abortion performed in California.

# The Proposal:

Proposition ___ would declare it to be City policy to:

- Serve as a safe place for people seeking reproductive care, including abortions;
- Protect the rights of pregnant people to control their medical decisions;
- Safeguard the confidentiality of reproductive health information;

Proposition __ would also:

- Create a Reproductive Freedom Fund that accepts grants and gifts to support reproductive rights and services;
- Require DPH to maintain a public website that lists facilities that provide abortions or emergency contraception or offer referrals for these services, and lists limited services pregnancy centers in San Francisco;
- Authorize DPH to post signs outside limited services pregnancy centers to inform the public that those facilities do not provide abortions or emergency contraception or offer referrals for these services; these signs would also indicate where to obtain these services;
- Limit City-funded facilities that provide abortions from requiring providers to have additional medical qualifications beyond those required by law;
- Prohibit City officials from providing information to law enforcement agencies of other states or the federal government concerning a person’s use or possession of contraception, use of in vitro fertilization, pregnancy status or choice to get an abortion;
- Modify the City’s zoning law so that reproductive health clinics may operate in more areas of San Francisco, including all floors in nonresidential districts and corner lots in residential districts.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote “yes,” you want City policy and law to support, protect and expand reproductive rights and services.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want to make these changes.

# Proposition: B Final Digest - Community Health and Medical Facilities, Street Safety, Public Spaces, and Shelter to Reduce Homelessness Bond.pdf

# Community Health and Medical Facilities, Street Safety, Public Spaces, and Shelter to Reduce Homelessness Bond*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Friday, July 26, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City provides and maintains public facilities and infrastructure.

The City can issue voter-approved general obligation bonds to help fund these projects.

The Citizens’ General Obligation Bond Oversight Committee reviews how the bond proceeds are spent.

# The Proposal:

Proposition ___ is a bond measure that would allow the City to borrow up to $390 million by issuing general obligation bonds. The City would fund:

- up to $99.1 million to acquire or improve community health centers, including up to $71.1 million to seismically retrofit and renovate the Chinatown Public Health Center and up to $28 million to relocate the City Clinic;
- up to $66 million to repair and renovate Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (General Hospital) and Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center;
- up to $40 million to seismically retrofit General Hospital;
- up to $63.9 million for street and sidewalk safety projects;
- up to $41 million to improve and modernize public spaces in downtown San Francisco;
- up to $25 million for Harvey Milk Plaza;
- up to $5 million for parks and recreation centers; and
- up to $50 million for shelter or interim housing sites to reduce family homelessness.

Proposition ___ would require the Citizens’ General Obligation Bond Oversight Committee to review how this bond money is spent.

City policy is to limit the amount of money it borrows by issuing new bonds only as prior bonds are paid off. If needed, an increase in the property tax rate would be allowed. Landlords would be permitted to pass through up to 50% of any resulting property tax increase to tenants.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote "yes," you want the City to issue up to $390 million in general obligation bonds to fund projects related to community health and medical facilities, street safety, public spaces and interim housing to reduce family homelessness.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want the City to issue these bonds.

# Proposition: N Final Digest - First Responder Student Loan and Training Reimbursement Fund PDF.pdf

# First Responder Student Loan and Training Reimbursement Fund*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

|Status:|Final Digest|
|---|---|
|On:|Friday, August 2, 2024|
|Members:|Packard, Anderson, Wong, Wang|

# The Way It Is Now:

The City reimburses employees for some job-related educational and training expenses, but the City does not reimburse student loans for any of its employees.

The City does not have a fund into which the Board of Supervisors (Board) and Mayor can put City money or receive private donations to reimburse City employees’ student loans or job-related educational and training expenses.

The Department of Human Resources oversees the hiring, development, support and retention of the City’s workforce.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ would create a City fund dedicated to helping reimburse eligible employees for their student loans and job-related educational and training expenses up to $25,000. Only sworn members of the Police, Fire and Sheriff’s departments, paramedics, Registered Nurses and 911 dispatchers, supervisors or coordinators who meet certain requirements would be eligible to receive payments from the fund.

In the future, the Board and the Mayor could decide to place City money into this fund, but the City would not be required to do so. The City could receive private donations in this fund.

Proposition __ would allow the Department of Human Resources to create a program to provide student loan and education and training reimbursement payments up to $25,000 for each eligible employee. These payments would only begin once the fund contains at least $1,000,000 (one million dollars).

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote “yes,” you want to create a fund that the City could use to help reimburse eligible City employees, including police officers, firefighters, sheriffs, paramedics, Registered Nurses and 911 dispatchers, for student loans and education and training programs.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want to create this fund.

# Proposition: G Final Digest - Funding Rental Subsidies for Affordable Housing Developments Serving Low Income Seniors, Families, and Persons with Disabilities.pdf

# Funding Rental Subsidies for Affordable Housing Developments Serving Low Income Seniors, Families, and Persons with Disabilities*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

# Status:

Final Digest

# On:

Friday, July 26, 2024

# Members:

Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

State law requires San Francisco to adequately plan to meet the housing needs of people at all income levels in the community. Low-income households in San Francisco have incomes that do not exceed 80% of area median income (AMI). Extremely low-income (ELI) households have incomes that do not exceed 35% of AMI.

The City provides loans to acquire, build or rehabilitate affordable housing to meet the needs of low-income households, but these loan programs do not fully subsidize the difference between the cost to operate these units and the rents ELI households can afford. As a result, relatively few housing units are offered at rents affordable to ELI households.

The City funds rental subsidies for a limited number of affordable housing developments that make rental units available to ELI seniors. The City provides the funds directly to the owner to subsidize the rents of ELI seniors. The City also provides rental subsidies for households that formerly experienced homelessness.

Some of the funding for these two subsidy programs comes from state or federal grants and other funding comes from the General Fund through the annual budget process. There is currently no permanent funding source or annual commitment to fund these programs. There are currently no equivalent programs for ELI families or persons with disabilities. The Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD), which coordinates the City’s affordable housing policies, administers these loan and rental subsidy programs.

# The Proposal:

Proposition ___ is a Charter amendment that would create an Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund for Seniors, Families and Persons with Disabilities (Fund).

Under Proposition ___, each year the City would be required to contribute to the Fund:

- beginning in fiscal year 2026-27, at least $8.25 million a year; and
- until fiscal year 2045-46, at least the prior year amount, adjusted by up to 3% based on the City’s revenues.

If, in any year the City’s projected budget deficit is $250 million or more, the City may reduce its contribution to the Fund, provided that the City contributes at least $4 million in 2026-27 and at least $8.25 million in each later year.

Under Proposition __, MOHCD would administer the Fund by disbursing money to the owners of certain new and existing affordable housing developments in San Francisco to subsidize the rent of ELI households consisting of seniors, families or persons with disabilities with incomes up to 35% of AMI. The funds would subsidize the difference between the amount these tenants can afford and the rents the owner would otherwise charge. The Fund would end on December 31, 2046, unless voters reauthorize it.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote "yes," you want to amend the Charter to appropriate at least $8.25 million a year to pay for rental subsidies for affordable housing developments serving ELI households of seniors, families and persons with disabilities.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want the City to make these changes.

# Proposition: J Final Digest - Funding Programs Serving Children, Youth, and Families.pdf

# Funding Programs Serving Children, Youth, and Families*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Monday, July 29, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City funds services for children, youth and their families through the Children and Youth Fund, the Public Education Enrichment Fund and the Student Success Fund, and other programs.

The San Francisco Unified School District (School District) is separate from the City and operates the San Francisco public school system. The School District receives some funding from the City.

# Children and Youth Fund

The Children and Youth Fund supports services for children and youth through 24 years of age. The Charter requires the City to contribute a dedicated portion of annual property tax revenues to this fund. The City uses these funds to provide services, including child care, health services, job training, social services, educational, recreational and cultural programs, and delinquency prevention services. The City must spend more than the amount it spent in Fiscal Year 2000-2001 to fund these services. The amount spent in Fiscal Year 2000-2001 is referred to as the “Children and Youth Fund Baseline.”

# Public Education Enrichment Fund

The Public Education Enrichment Fund (PEEF) supports early childhood education programs and general education programs, including art, music, sports and libraries. The Charter requires the City to contribute a certain amount to this fund each year, adjusted annually. The City must spend more than the amount it spent in Fiscal Year 2002-2003 to fund these services. The amount spent in Fiscal Year 2002-2003 is referred to as the “PEEF Baseline.” In addition to the required PEEF funding, the Board of Supervisors and Mayor may provide additional funding to the School District.

# Student Success Fund

The City grants money from the Student Success Fund to the School District and individual schools for programs that improve student academic achievement and social/emotional wellness. The Charter requires the City to contribute money to the fund each year through Fiscal Year 2037-2038. In Fiscal Year 2024-2025, the City must place $35 million into this fund. That amount will continue to increase each year, though the City may place less money in the fund under certain circumstances.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ is a Charter amendment that would change the way the City evaluates funding for services to children, youth and their families by monitoring outcomes.

Proposition __ would create an Our Children, Our Families Initiative (OCOF Initiative), led by the Mayor and the Superintendent of the School District and staffed by employees of the City and School District, to ensure that related funds are used effectively. This group would evaluate expenditures from the Children and Youth Fund and the PEEF and would prepare an annual report for the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors, who must approve these expenditures as part of the budget process.

Proposition __ would require the School District to report on PEEF funds and spending to the OCOF Initiative each year. Every five years, the School District must submit a proposal describing how it plans to use these funds. The City’s future contributions to the School District from the PEEF depend on their review and approval of the School District’s proposal.

# Proposition: M Final Digest - Changes to Business Taxes.pdf

# Changes to Business Taxes*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Friday, July 26, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City collects various business taxes annually, including:

- A gross receipts tax that is a percentage of a business’s San Francisco gross receipts. Depending on business type, the City calculates a business’s San Francisco gross receipts based on sales in San Francisco, payroll expenses for employees working there, or both. Rates range from 0.053% to 1.008% and are scheduled to increase in coming years. Rates depend on business type, and higher rates apply as a business generates more gross receipts. For 2024, most small businesses with gross receipts up to $2.25 million are exempt.
- A homelessness gross receipts tax that is an additional tax on business activities with San Francisco gross receipts over $50 million. Rates range from 0.175% to 0.69%.
- An overpaid executive gross receipts tax that is an additional tax on businesses that pay their highest-paid managerial employee much higher than the median compensation they pay their San Francisco employees. Rates are between 0.1% and 0.6%.
- A business registration fee that is an additional tax. For most businesses, the fee is currently between $47 and $45,150, based on business type and amount of gross receipts.
- An administrative office tax that is a tax on payroll expenses paid by certain large businesses instead of these other business taxes. The combined rates in 2024 range from 3.04% to 5.44%, and in 2025 are scheduled to range from 3.11% to 5.51%. Business registration fees for these businesses currently range from $19,682 to $45,928.

State law limits the total revenue that the City may spend each year. The voters may approve increases to this spending limit for up to four years.

# The Proposal:

The proposed measure would change the City’s business taxes to:

- For the gross receipts tax:
- exempt most small businesses with gross receipts up to $5 million (increased by inflation).
- reduce the number of business types from 14 to seven;
- calculate San Francisco gross receipts based more on sales and less on payroll expenses, depending on the type of business;
- change rates to between 0.1% and 3.716%;
- Apply the homelessness gross receipts tax on business activities with San Francisco gross receipts over $25 million, at rates between 0.162% and 1.64%.
- Modify how the City calculates the overpaid executive gross receipts tax, determine who pays that tax, and set the rates between 0.02% and 0.129%.

# Proposition: C Final Digest - Inspector General PDF_0.pdf

# Inspector General*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Friday, August 2, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The Controller is appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Board of Supervisors to oversee the City’s financial affairs. The Charter requires the Controller to receive and investigate complaints concerning the quality and delivery of government services, wasteful or inefficient City government practices, misuse of City funds, and improper activities by City officers and employees. The Charter also requires the Controller to monitor the level and effectiveness of services the City provides to its residents.

Other City departments, including the City Attorney, District Attorney and Ethics Commission, have jurisdiction to investigate fraud, abuse and other matters related to public integrity. The Department of Human Resources has jurisdiction to investigate employee misconduct.

The Controller can examine the records of City boards, commissions, officers and departments, but the Controller cannot issue subpoenas to require third parties such as City contractors, permittees or lobbyists to produce records. State law authorizes employees of the Controller’s Office to execute search warrants under certain circumstances, but there is no similar provision in the Charter.

The Charter also establishes a separate department called the Sheriff’s Department Office of Inspector General to investigate complaints involving employees of the Sheriff’s Office. That department is not connected to the Controller’s Office.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ would amend the Charter to create a new position of Inspector General in the Controller’s Office to review and investigate complaints of fraud, waste and abuse. The Controller would appoint the Inspector General, subject to the approval of the Mayor and Board of Supervisors. The Controller would supervise and could terminate the Inspector General.

The Inspector General would consult with the Ethics Commission, City Attorney, District Attorney and Department of Human Resources regarding those departments’ investigations involving fraud, waste or abuse. The Inspector General could either refer specific matters to those departments, could investigate those matters in coordination with the relevant department, or could conduct its own investigation. At least twice a year, the Inspector General would be required to issue public reports on its activities and the outcomes of all investigations by other city agencies into matters concerning public integrity.

Proposition __ would give the Controller power to issue subpoenas to third parties, including contractors, permittees and lobbyists. It would also allow the Inspector General, the Controller and employees of the Controller’s Office to execute search warrants when permitted by State law.

Under Proposition __, the Sheriff’s Department Office of Inspector General would be renamed the “Office of Sheriff’s Inspector General.”

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote "yes," you want to create the new position of Inspector General in the Controller’s Office to review and investigate complaints of fraud, waste and abuse, and grant the Controller’s Office the power to issue subpoenas and execute search warrants when permitted by State law.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want to make these changes.

# Proposition: A Final Digest - Schools Improvement and Safety Bond.pdf

# Schools Improvement and Safety Bond*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Friday, July 26, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The San Francisco Unified School District (School District) operates the San Francisco public school system and educates more than 49,500 students from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. The School District builds, repairs and maintains its facilities, primarily using funds from voter-approved bond measures, as well as from local parcel taxes and developer fees.

In order to issue general obligation bonds, the School District must provide voters with a list of types of projects on which the funds will be spent.

Under State law, school districts cannot use bond funds for teacher and administrator salaries or operating expenses.

The most recent school bond was approved by voters in 2016. Property tax revenues are used to pay the principal and interest on general obligation bonds.

# The Proposal:

Proposition ___ would authorize the School District to borrow up to $790 million by issuing general obligation bonds. The School District may use these bond funds to improve, repair and upgrade any of its sites to:

- address health and safety risks by making seismic upgrades, improving accessibility for people with disabilities, fixing damaged buildings and removing hazardous materials;
- repair and replace major building systems, including electrical, heating, water, sewer, lighting, security and fire sprinkler systems;
- modify building interiors, such as classrooms, and exteriors, including playgrounds, fences and gates, fields and bleachers, and landscaping;
- add or expand existing classrooms or school buildings, including portable classrooms and transitional kindergarten facilities;
- upgrade security and technology infrastructure;
- build or renovate common, administrative or athletic areas, such as kitchens, student nutrition facilities, theaters, auditoriums, gymnasiums, locker rooms, offices, transportation facilities and infrastructure, warehouses, and buildings and grounds facilities;
- construct a new central food hub;
- replace temporary classroom facilities with permanent structures;
- perform work necessary to comply with applicable codes or regulations.

The School District would be required to create an independent citizens' oversight committee to review and report on the use of these bond funds.

Proposition ___ may require an increase in the property tax to pay principal and interest on the bonds. This measure requires the approval of 55% of the votes cast.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote "yes," you want the School District to issue up to $790 million in general obligation bonds to improve, repair and upgrade School District sites, and to build new facilities.

# Proposition: I Final Digest - Retirement Benefits for Nurses and 911 Operators_0.pdf

# Retirement Benefits for Nurses and 911 Operators*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

|Status:|Final Digest|
|---|---|
|On:|Friday, August 2, 2024|
|Members:|Packard, Anderson, Wong, Wang|

# The Way It Is Now:

The City provides its employees with pension benefits through the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System (SFERS).

SFERS determines the pension payment a retiree receives under each plan through a calculation based on the employee’s final compensation, years of service and age at retirement. That calculation varies between plans.

SFERS provides different plans for employees based on job type, including:

- Miscellaneous Plans for 911 dispatchers and their supervisors and coordinators, as well as most other City employees;
- Safety Plans for uniformed employees of the Police Department and Fire Department;
- A Miscellaneous Safety Plan for certain probation officers, District Attorney investigators and juvenile court counselors.

In general, retirees receive greater pension benefits under the Safety Plans and the Miscellaneous Safety Plan than they do under the Miscellaneous Plans. Although 911 dispatchers are classified as First Responders in California, they do not receive Safety-level retirement pensions.

City employees contribute a percentage of their salary toward their retirement benefits. In some circumstances, employees may also purchase service credits to increase their pension benefits.

A “per diem nurse” is a Registered Nurse employed by the City on an occasional and temporary basis. Since 1988, per diem nurses have not been members of SFERS and do not receive any pension service credit for the hours they work on a per diem basis.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ would allow eligible Registered Nurses to purchase service credit for hours they worked on a per diem basis. Registered Nurses who are or become members of SFERS and have worked an average of 32 hours or more per week for at least one year could purchase up to three years of service credit for time they previously worked solely as per diem nurses for the City before they became members of SFERS.

Proposition __ would also move 911 dispatchers, supervisors and coordinators from the Miscellaneous Plans to the Miscellaneous Safety Plan for compensation those employees earn on and after January 4, 2025. As members of the Miscellaneous Safety Plan, these employees would be required to pay an increased amount into the pension plan and would receive increased pension benefits at retirement.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote “yes,” you want to allow Registered Nurses who are members of the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System and meet certain requirements to purchase credits toward their total pension years of service for time previously worked as per diem nurses, and to allow 911 dispatchers, supervisors and coordinators to increase their pension benefits by joining the SFERS Miscellaneous Safety Plan for time worked starting in January 2025.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want to make these changes.

# Proposition: D Final Digest - City Commissions and Mayoral Authority PDF.pdf

# City Commissions and Mayoral Authority

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Monday, July 29, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City currently has about 130 appointed boards, commissions and advisory bodies (commissions). Of the 130 commissions, 44 are established in the Charter and can be changed only by the voters. The rest of the commissions are created by ordinance and typically may be amended or deleted by act of the Board of Supervisors (Board). Under current law:

- There is no limit on how many commissions the City may have.
- Many commissions have decision-making authority. Others are merely advisory. Some decide appeals and other administrative proceedings.
- Some commissions oversee and set policy for City departments. These commissions generally nominate candidates to serve as department head. The Mayor has authority to appoint the department head solely from the candidates the commission nominates. Generally, only the commission has authority to remove the department head.
- For many commissions, the Mayor appoints at least a majority of its members and the Board appoints the rest. The Mayor’s appointments are generally subject to Board confirmation or rejection.
- The Mayor and Board may remove members from some commissions only for official misconduct.
- The City pays members of some commissions.
- The City provides members of some commissions with health care benefits.
- The Police Commission adopts rules governing police officers’ conduct.

# The Proposal:

The proposed measure would make these changes to the City Charter:

- Limit the City to a total of 65 commissions.
- Retain 20 Charter commissions, including Police, Fire, Recreation and Park, Municipal Transportation Agency, Public Utilities and Ethics, and those overseeing employee health benefits and retirement. The measure would also allow the City to retain commissions that are required by federal or state law.
- Remove 24 Charter commissions, including Public Health, Library, Human Rights, Human Services, Arts, Environment, Small Business and Juvenile Probation, subject to the City reauthorizing or restructuring them within the 65-commission limit. The Board could later reestablish these bodies as advisory commissions by ordinance.
- Establish a five-member task force that would recommend within nine months which commissions should be reauthorized or restructured or dissolved to stay within the 65-commission limit. This task force would be appointed by the Mayor, the President of the Board, the Controller, the City Administrator and the City Attorney.

# Proposition: F Final Digest - Police Staffing and Deferred Retirement PDF_0.pdf

# Police Staffing and Deferred Retirement*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

|Status:|Final Digest|
|---|---|
|On:|Friday, August 2, 2024|
|Members:|Packard, Anderson, Wong, Wang|

# The Way It Is Now:

The Police Commission (Commission) oversees the San Francisco Police Department (Department). The Charter requires the Chief of the Department (Police Chief) to submit a report every two years to the Commission. This report describes the current number of full-duty sworn officers and recommends adequate staffing levels of full-duty sworn officers for the next two years. The Commission must consider this report and recommendation when it approves the Department’s budget. The Charter does not define “full-duty sworn officers.”

The San Francisco Employee Retirement System is the retirement and pension system for City employees. Under the Charter, police officers are eligible for retirement benefits, with pension payments based on their compensation, age and length of service. The Charter does not allow City employees, including police officers, to continue working full time for the City after retirement. But the City may rehire retired City employees to work a limited number of hours each year while they also collect retirement benefits.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ would amend the Charter to define “full-duty sworn officer” to mean a full-time officer except those on long-term leaves of absence, recruits who are training at the Police Academy and officers assigned to the San Francisco International Airport. To reduce the administrative burden, the measure would require the Police Chief to provide a report every three years, instead of two, on current full-duty sworn officers and recommend future staffing to the Commission. The Commission would report annually to the Board of Supervisors (Board) on the Department’s progress on meeting its staffing goals, including its goal of increasing the representation of women in the Department to 30% of new recruits by 2030.

Proposition ___ would establish a Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) for eligible police officers. Full-duty police officers in the ranks of Officer, Sergeant and Inspector who are at least 50 years old and have at least 25 years of eligible service with the Department or another law enforcement agency could participate. Participants would continue to work full-time for the Department at their current salary and benefit levels. Participants must agree to perform neighborhood patrol work or conduct investigations, regardless of their previous assignment. Participants would only be allowed to participate for up to five years. The pension payments the participant would have collected upon retirement would be placed into a tax-deferred and interest-bearing account. When their DROP period ends, participants must stop work for the City and would receive their deferred monthly pension payments with interest. The Board could limit the number of DROP participants.

Proposition _ authorizes the DROP program for an initial five-year period. Thereafter, the Board would have the authority to continue the program every five years until it expires.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote “yes,” you want to amend the Charter to define “full-duty sworn officer”; require the Police Chief to make a report and recommend future staffing of full-duty sworn officers to the Police Commission every three years instead of two; require the Commission to report annually to the Board on Department staffing; and create a five-year program with possible renewals allowing police officers to continue working for the Department after retiring, with pension payments deferred while they are working.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want to make these changes.

# Retirement Benefits for Firefighters*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

|Status:|Final Digest|
|---|---|
|On:|Friday, August 2, 2024|
|Members:|Packard, Anderson, Wong, Wang|

# The Way It Is Now:

The City provides its employees with pension benefits through the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System (SFERS). Employees who meet age and service requirements receive pension payments upon retirement. Members of the Fire Department are eligible to retire at age 50 if they have at least five years of credit for City service.

A member’s pension generally increases with the member’s age, compensation and number of years worked. The pension is a percentage of the member’s final compensation at retirement. SFERS calculates that percentage based on the member’s age at retirement and their number of years of City service. No member of the Fire Department may receive a pension that is more than 90% of their final compensation.

Members of the Fire Department hired before January 7, 2012, could reach the 90% maximum percentage for their pension at age 55. Members hired on or after January 7, 2012, could reach that maximum three years later, at age 58.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ would amend the Charter to change pension benefits for members of the Fire Department hired on or after January 7, 2012. Proposition __ would lower from 58 to 55 the age at which these members can obtain the highest pension based on age. These changes would make pension benefits for members hired on and after January 7, 2012, the same as benefits for members hired before January 7, 2012.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote “yes,” you want to amend the Charter to change how pension benefits are calculated for members of the Fire Department hired on or after January 7, 2012, by lowering the age these members can receive the highest pension from 58 to 55, and make those benefits the same as members hired before January 7, 2012.

# Proposition: L Final Digest - Additional Business Tax on Transportation Network Companies and Autonomous Vehicle Businesses PDF_0.pdf

# Additional Business Tax on Transportation Network Companies and Autonomous Vehicle Businesses*

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Friday, August 2, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City collects taxes on gross receipts from many businesses in San Francisco (Gross Receipts Tax). For most businesses, the Gross Receipts Tax rate is between 0.053% and 1.008% of San Francisco gross receipts, with some rates scheduled to increase in coming years.

The City imposes a per-ride tax on certain transportation businesses that provide prearranged rides that originate in San Francisco. This tax applies to transportation network companies, which connect drivers to passengers, and businesses providing rides in some types of autonomous vehicles. Transportation network companies do not include taxi or limousine services. The rates for that tax are between 1.5% and 3.25% of the fares attributable to passenger rides within San Francisco.

Autonomous vehicles can operate without a human driver and some can transport passengers.

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency operates a public transportation system (Muni) of buses, light rail vehicles, streetcars and cable cars.

State law limits the total revenue that the City may spend each year. The voters may approve increases to this spending limit for up to four years.

# The Proposal:

In addition to existing taxes, the proposed measure would create a new gross receipts tax on transportation network companies and autonomous vehicle businesses. This new tax would be on passenger transportation service gross receipts in San Francisco above $500,000. The tax rates would be:

|Taxable Gross Receipts|Tax Rate|
|---|---|
|$500,000.01 to $1,000,000|1%|
|$1,000,000.01 to $2,500,000|2.5%|
|$2,500,000.01 to $25,000,000|3.5%|
|Over $25,000,000|4.5%|

The City would use the funds it collects from the new tax to:

- Preserve, maintain or increase Muni public transportation services;
- Improve or preserve Muni service to public schools, libraries and parks by increasing service frequency, expanding and adding new routes;
- Maintain or expand discount fare or fare-free programs by Muni for people with disabilities, seniors, youth, students and low-income passengers.

The tax would remain in place unless the voters repeal it through a future ballot measure. The Board of Supervisors would have authority to amend the tax by a two-thirds vote, so long as it does not undermine the intent of the tax.

This proposal would also increase the City’s spending limit for four years.

# Proposition: E Final Digest - Creating a Task Force to Recommend Changing, Eliminating or Combining City Commissions PDF.pdf

# Creating a Task Force to Recommend Changing, Eliminating or Combining City Commissions

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

Status: Final Digest

On: Monday, July 29, 2024

Members: Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang

# The Way It Is Now:

The City currently has about 130 boards, commissions and advisory bodies (commissions) that make policy and other decisions for the City or provide nonbinding advice to City officials and departments. Most City commissions that are created by ordinance do not have the authority to make City decisions and instead provide nonbinding advice to City departments and officials.

Members of the Board of Supervisors (Board), the Mayor and City departments have authority to introduce an ordinance, which must be approved by a majority of the Board. The Mayor has authority to veto it. Voters may also approve an ordinance and require their approval for any change to a voter-approved ordinance.

Other commissions are established by Charter amendment. Only voters may amend the Charter. Most of these Charter commissions oversee City departments and have authority to set City policy and make binding decisions.

# The Proposal:

Proposition __ is a Charter amendment that would create a Commission Streamlining Task Force (Task Force) to review the structure of the City’s commissions and recommend to the Mayor and the Board by February 1, 2026, how the City could change, eliminate or consolidate commissions to improve the administration of City government.

# The Task Force would include five members:

- the City Administrator or a designated employee of their department;
- the Controller or a designated employee of their department;
- the City Attorney or a designated employee of their department;
- a public sector organized labor representative appointed by the President of the Board; and
- a person with expertise in open and accountable government appointed by the Mayor.

Proposition __ would also require the Board’s Budget and Legislative Analyst to prepare a report on how much it costs the City to support each current commission, and how much it would save if certain commissions were eliminated or consolidated.

Proposition __ would authorize the Task Force to implement its recommendations in these ways:

- If the Task Force recommends changes to commissions established by ordinance, the Task Force may introduce ordinances to make those changes.
- Any ordinance the Task Force introduces would take effect 90 days after introduction unless the Board rejects it by supermajority vote of at least eight members.
- If the Task Force recommends changes to commissions established by voter-approved ordinance, those changes may also require voter approval at a future election before the City may implement them.

# Proposition: K Final Digest - Reserving the Upper Great Highway as Public Open Recreation Space.pdf

# Reserving the Upper Great Highway as Public Open Recreation Space

# Digest by the Ballot Simplification Committee

|Status:|Final Digest|
|---|---|
|On:|Friday, July 26, 2024|
|Members:|Packard, Anderson, Wong, Troy, Wang|

# The Way It Is Now:

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the City closed certain public streets to private motor vehicles, reserving the streets as public open space for recreational purposes. These closures included the Great Highway between Lincoln Way and Sloat Boulevard (Upper Great Highway), adjacent to Ocean Beach.

In May 2022, the City replaced the pandemic restrictions on the Upper Great Highway with a pilot program closing the Upper Great Highway to private motor vehicles on Friday afternoons, weekends and holidays. The closure does not apply to emergency vehicles, official government vehicles, intra-park transit shuttle buses and similar vehicles authorized to transport people. This pilot program is scheduled to end on December 31, 2025. When the pilot program ends, the Upper Great Highway will be open to private motor vehicles.

The City’s General Plan sets objectives and policies for land uses within San Francisco, including streets. The California Coastal Act guides land uses along the California coast. Changes in use to the Upper Great Highway may require amendments to the General Plan and approvals under the California Coastal Act.

The Recreation and Parks Commission has jurisdiction over most public parks and other recreational facilities in San Francisco, including the Upper Great Highway. Under the Commission’s direction, the Recreation and Parks’ General Manager oversees the use of those recreational facilities.

# The Proposal:

Proposition ___ is an ordinance that would allow the City to use the Upper Great Highway for public open recreation space, permanently closing it to private motor vehicles seven days a week, with limited exceptions. It would continue to allow emergency vehicles, official government vehicles, intra-park transit shuttle buses and similar authorized vehicles to access the Upper Great Highway at all times. The General Manager of the Recreation and Parks Department would have the authority to determine an emergency exists and allow private motor vehicles to use the Upper Great Highway.

Proposition __ would require, within 180 days of voter approval of this measure, the City to seek any other approvals necessary to permanently close the Upper Great Highway to private motor vehicles. Those approvals may include amendments to the City’s General Plan and approvals under the California Coastal Act.

If Proposition ___ is passed by voters, the current pilot program would remain in place until all necessary approvals are obtained and permits granted, or, until the pilot program is scheduled to end on December 31, 2025.

# A "YES" Vote Means:

If you vote “yes,” you want the City to use the Upper Great Highway as public open recreation space, permanently closing it to private motor vehicles seven days a week, with limited exceptions.

# A "NO" Vote Means:

If you vote “no,” you do not want the City to make these changes.
