# Ballotbot
This project is a chatbot powered by LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) and a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to answer queries and provide insights related to Project 2025. The chatbot can handle structured and unstructured data, making it a useful tool for managing and interacting with the project's knowledge base.

# Features
Efficient Query Handling: Use LlamaIndex to quickly search through large datasets related to Project 2025.
Natural Language Understanding: Powered by an LLM (such as LLaMA or GPT), the chatbot can understand and respond to user queries in natural language.
Real-Time Updates: Automatically update the chatbot's knowledge base as new data is added.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. Install the following dependencies:

LlamaIndex
Transformers (for interacting with your LLM)
FastAPI or Flask (for building the API)
Pydantic (for request/response models)
Install dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ballotbot.git
cd project2025-chatbot
Configure the settings:
Update config/settings.py with your LLM API keys or local LLaMA model path, as well as other configurations like the port for FastAPI or Flask.

Build the index:
Ensure the data you want to index is located in the /data folder. Then, build the LlamaIndex by running:

bash
Copy code
python index/index_builder.py
Start the chatbot:
To run the chatbot (FastAPI/Flask server):

bash
Copy code
python app/app.py
The server should now be running, and you can interact with the chatbot via API endpoints (or integrate with a frontend).

Usage
You can query the chatbot by sending POST requests to the API. Here is an example using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/query" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What is the current milestone for Project 2025?"}'
The chatbot will respond with relevant information based on the indexed data.

Sample API Endpoints
POST /query: Send a query to the chatbot.
GET /health: Check the server health status.
Testing
Run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

bash
Copy code
pytest
Future Improvements
Frontend Integration: Build a web or mobile interface for easier interaction with the chatbot.
Real-Time Data Sync: Set up a pipeline to automatically update the chatbot with new data.
Multi-Language Support: Extend the chatbot to handle multiple languages.
